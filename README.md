**Why are you doing this?**    
I am very excited for teaching and introducing people to R. I strongly believe that we do not have to reinvent the wheel if not necessary so collective work is important.

**What can you do to thank me?**     
This is a weird thing that someone asked me. I just would really appreciate it if you share it with your peers and also give credit where credit is due.
